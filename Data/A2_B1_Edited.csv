1	"First, they should buy as many books as they can and read them."
1	"They can study a lot of things from the many books."
1	"If they go to the library, they can read many books, but they are forbidden to write in the books of the library."

1	"I agree with it."
1	"I have three reasons to support my answer."
1	"First, I think we should have a part-time job to learn how to work before we are employed in a company."
1	"We go to a university to learn many things before being employed, and we have much time to do something after classes."
1	"We can choose whether or not we have a part-time job to learn how to work."
1	"So we should have it."
1	"Second, I suppose we should know how hard earning is."
1	"I had not known that earning money to live is really hard until I had a part-time job."
1	"And I could thank my parents."
1	"I think it is important for us to know how hard earning is and to thank our parents."
1	"Third, we can use payments for part-time jobs to do many things for experience."
1	"As I said, we have much time in a university."
1	"And we can do something for ourselves by using payments for part-time jobs."
1	"For example, we can go travel and see the world, buy books, organize a student conference, and so on."
1	"I think that experiences will help us after we graduate."
1	"So I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
1	"Because we can learn how to work, we can know how hard earning is, and we can get good experiences thanks to a part-time job."
1	"I disagree with that."
1	"To be sure, to have a part-time job to live is vital for college students."
1	"But it isn't good to earn money to play."
1	"Generally speaking, college students have more free time than high school students and junior high school students."
1	"And how to use their time all depends on them."
1	"Many college students spend a lot of time working part-time because they need to earn money to play with friends."
1	"Making many friends in college is good, however, and studying is also important."
1	"In college, there are many things for students to do, for example, taking part in an internship, a club, a seminar, and so on."
1	"So, college students should actively take up what they can do only in college."
1	"By challenging themselves a lot, they are able to their best with confidence when they work in the future."
1	"Wages of a part-time job are very low generally, and working part-time is very tiring for college students."
1	"So, it costs them much time and effort to get money by working part-time."
1	"As a result, they often can't concentrate on a class or study for a test in college."
1	"It is not good for them."
1	"Therefore, I don't think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
1	"I agree that college students should have a part-time job."
1	"There are five reasons to support my opinion."
1	"First, by doing a part-time job, they can find earning money very hard."
1	"So they will use their money seriously."
1	"And college students have much time."
1	"So if they want travel abroad, they can make their own money by doing a part-time job."
1	"Planning how to use money is helpful when people begin to work."
1	"Second, if students do a part-time job, they can meet people of a variety of generations, from children to senior adults."
1	"So they can know various people's ways of thinking."
1	"Third, the harder they work at a part-time job, the better evaluated they are."
1	"For example, their wage per hour may go up."
1	"Fourth, by doing many kinds of part-time jobs, they can know their suitable future job, such as teaching children or serving customers in shops."
1	"In fact, I have a lot of friends who want to become teachers."
1	"And they teach junior high school students."
1	"Lastly, students have responsibility for their jobs."
1	"It is an important thing when they work."
1	"As above, they can know society's basic rules."
1	"This is why I agree that college students should have a part-time job."
1	"I agree with the statement."
1	"There are three reasons."
1	"First, college students need a lot of money."
1	"They must pay money to the college."
1	"And they need to buy clothes, and to eat and drink in order to be friendly."
1	"They should not have their parents pay a lot for them."
1	"They should pay the costs themselves."
1	"So they should have a part-time job."
1	"Second, they can make friends when they work."
1	"By working together, they will become friendly."
1	"It is very good to have many friends."
1	"For example, when a person has a problem, he or she can ask friends to give advice."
1	"Their advice might be different from college friends."
1	"It is important to hear many kinds of advice."
1	"Finally, students are able to practice for their jobs in the future by having a part-time job."
1	"If they have not had a part-time job, they don't know what kind of job is good for them."
1	"To have a part-time job is a good chance for students to get themselves noticed."
1	"Some people might say that they can study more if they don't have a job."
1	"It is true."
1	"However, I think it is more important to have the job."
1	"The students will be good persons."
1	"It is why I agree with the statement."
1	"I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job because I think college students have skills to work in adult society."
1	"Today, part-time jobs have spread to many parts of the industry and have taken important roles in these fields."
1	"Many companies want young people to work at part-time jobs, so we who are college students, young men and women, have more chances to have many experiences of the hard things in work in adult society."
1	"If we have both actual first-hand experience and second-hand accounts that are heard, listened, or talked about, we can lay a good foundation for the future."
1	"For example, I am working in Kobetsukan, a private school with teaching like in a formal school, as a part-time worker."
1	"That is my first job to make money, and it teaches me how I am seen as a worker in adult society."
1	"In the private school, I am called Narusawa, Teacher, and students see me as a professional teacher, but I cannot judge whether this is true or not."
1	"When I was seen as a professional worker, I could know the meaning of work in the adult society."
1	"It is that I have to play a role as the character other people expect me to be."
1	"That I learned that meaning is the biggest value of working in a part-time job."
1	"I agree with this idea."
1	"I think college students should have some part-time jobs."
1	"I also think they should study hard while they are students."
1	"They must live well between part-time jobs and study."
1	"This is not because college students need much money."
1	"If they have a part-time job, they have many friends and meet many types of ways of thinking."
1	"I think there are two types of part-time job."
1	"The first one is a job in juku."
1	"If you do a part-time job in juku, you must have your own student."
1	"You have to study too."
1	"Your knowledge, which you have studied before, is useful."
1	"The second one is a job in stores."
1	"If you work as a shop clerk, you must communicate with a lot of customers."
1	"Your communication ability will make progress."
1	"You will have much responsibility."
1	"It is hard to continue a part-time job."
1	"But the very responsibility is needed in society."
1	"You will have to have responsibility in everything you do when you become an adult."
1	"If you have a part-time job, your sight will be wide."
1	"Before you start life in society, you should practice communicating with many other people and know how to survive in the society."
1	"I disagree with this opinion."
1	"I think a part-time job is not a need for college students."
1	"First, college students must study hard."
1	"It is very important for college students to study."
1	"I think that a student is a man who studies academics or is educated, not one who works."
1	"If a student thinks that study is finished, that is wrong."
1	"Study is not limited."
1	"Second, I think that a college student, whether working a part-time job now or not, will graduate and be working at least about four years later."
1	"After all, college students will have to work."
1	"So now college students should not work."
1	"Third, working is very hard and takes a lot of time."
1	"A man said that one hour for a college or university student has the value of ten years for an old man."
1	"Actually, the period that is spent in college or university is very important."
1	"Students must spend this time seriously."
1	"Fourth, there are a lot of things for students to do, besides study."
1	"Club activities may help improve a college student."
1	"They teach a lot of things that are not gotten in education."
1	"College students should spend much time in them, not in working."
1	"I think a part-time job is not a need for college students."
1	"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
1	"I have three reasons."
1	"First, if students have a part-time job, they can know how they work in society."
1	"They will have to work when they graduate from their colleges."
1	"So I think they should have time to prepare for working in society."
1	"Second, if they work in various situations, they will learn how they communicate with people."
1	"College students should experience various situations."
1	"Third, college students need a lot of money when they graduate from their colleges."
1	"So they must earn some money to use then."
1	"I think earning money when they become proper employees seems a bit late."
1	"Because most college students are adults, they should earn their own money."
1	"However, the most important thing they should do is study."
1	"College students should have enough time to study."
1	"It is useless for them to have no time for study because of working too hard."
1	"College students don't have to earn very much money."
1	"So I think they should work on summer vacation, winter vacation, and so on."
1	"If they experience working, it makes their life a more valuable thing."
1	"I agree with this statement, because having a part-time job is very important to learn our society."
1	"My opinion is that it is important for high school students to study many subjects, such as math, English, science, Japanese, and society."
1	"Therefore, high school students should not work a part-time job."
1	"But college students must work after graduating from a college, so while they are college students, they should learn about the work."
1	"So I think they should have a part-time job."
1	"They have a part-time job and they get some money."
1	"In addition, they can learn the hardness and the importance of getting some money."
1	"By getting some money, they can move in a wide area and go abroad to learn much knowledge, such as another country's culture, its play, its language, and its clothes."
1	"But they must not work too much, as their object is to learn much technical knowledge."
1	"I think they should not work more than four times a week, because working four times a week is more than half of the week."
1	"My conclusion is that college students should have a part-time job, but their main thing to do is studying, so they must not work too much."
1	"I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
1	"It is true that there are some bad aspects to having a part-time job for college students; for example, we use a lot of time for part-time jobs so we don't study or we sleep in class."
1	"But there are more good aspects to having a part-time job."
1	"I raise three reasons that I think so."
1	"First, we can know how difficult it is to earn money and how important money is."
1	"Many of us depend on our parents financially, so we don't know how difficult it is to earn money."
1	"Having a part-time job shows us how difficult."
1	"And understanding it leads us to respect our parents."
1	"Second, we can get new skills that we can't get at college."
1	"I think having a lot of skills, even if it seems that those skills are not important, will be useful in the future."
1	"Third, we get the opportunity to talk with adults when doing a part-time job."
1	"We can get a lot of information and knowledge."
1	"I think a lot of knowledge leads us to be happy."
1	"In conclusion, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job because we can know the difficulty of earning money and can get new skills and get the opportunity to talk with adults."
1	"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
1	"I have some reasons for it."
1	"First, they can learn some social manners by it."
1	"Second, they can learn the ability of communication through it."
1	"Third, they can understand how hard it is to get some money."
1	"The social manners and the ability of communication they learn from it help them when they graduate from their college and get their jobs."
1	"The understanding of the difficulty of getting money will make them thank their parents."
1	"Finally, college students need a lot of money."
1	"For example they need money when they go to lunch with their club members or they go shopping."
1	"They have to make money by themselves for their enjoyment."
1	"Therefore, I think a part-time job is important for them."
1	"In fact, I will start a part-time job next month."
1	"The reasons I will start it are also the above reasons."
1	"Especially, I would like to learn the ability of communication and I would like to understand how hard it is to get money."
1	"And I want to use the money I get for shopping."
1	"People who disagree with the statement may think that students only have to study hard."
1	"But studying at a desk cannot teach them some social manners or the importance of money."
1	"There are many things that are learned only by working."
1	"I think a part-time job is important for college students occasionally."
1	"There are three reasons that I thought of."
1	"First, a part-time job is important for students who are independent of their parents, such as me!"
1	"I am living in Nagoya alone."
1	"And I have no money."
1	"So, I can't afford to buy magazines, comics, and so on, and I can't go shopping, to karaoke, and on trips with my friends."
1	"I think money is important for enjoying college life."
1	"Second, I sometimes think a part-time job isn't necessary for us."
1	"I think that way because there are some students who work too hard and don't study hard."
1	"We are college students and aren't college fleeters!"
1	"So we should study hard in college life."
1	"And we should get special careers that we cannot get except for college life!"
1	"However, there are some careers that we get only at a part-time job."
1	"This is the third reason."
1	"For example, greeting is especially an important skill because greeting is needed in business and communication, but many college students, including me, are not good at greeting."
1	"A part-time job makes us better at it."
1	"That is why I think a part-time job is important, but sometimes it is not important."
1	"I think it's important for college students to have a part-time job."
1	"I have two reasons I think that."
1	"First, I think college students use much money, more than in high school, such as for club activities, the cost of a cell phone, trips to other countries or abroad with good friends, and enjoying playing something with good friends."
1	"There are many things that they want to and must do while passing a good college life."
1	"So, they need more money that they can spend."
1	"I think it's natural for college students to pay their own cost for things that they enjoy with someone."
1	"So, if someone thinks those are not special things because they just rely on their parents to give increased money that they can spend, I think it's a stupid thing."
1	"Of course, even if they work many hours at a part-time job, they can't pay for all the things that they spend on, such as rent, food cost, and study cost."
1	"But they can pay their own activity cost, trip cost, and costs of other things they enjoy."
1	"I still have a part-time job but I also take driving classes now."
1	"So, I think I have become a burden on my parents."
1	"Second, students should know the importance of money."
1	"Recently, parents have given almost more money than they need to live comfortably."
1	"I think they will forget the importance of money because they have spent much money, as I wrote before."
1	"For example, if they take a trip abroad, they will spend about two hundred thousand yen for one time."
1	"It's natural for them if they didn't earn the money by themselves."
1	"I think if they earn their own money in hard times, they can understand the importance of money."
1	"So, we should have part-time jobs."
1	"I agree that college students should have part-time jobs."
1	"Do we only study in college?"
1	"No, I don't think that."
1	"Of course if you work too hard in part-time jobs and don't study in college, it is too bad, but a part-time job in itself is not bad thing, for reasons I will show you."
1	"First, you can experience many things that you can't experience in college."
1	"For example you can teach math, English, and science for high school or junior high school students."
1	"In a part-time job, you can discover new sides of yourself."
1	"Second, we can enter a new community."
1	"For example, a senior manager will tell you how to communicate with customers, and you must tell that to younger workers too."
1	"Finally, you will utilize the job's experiences for your own work in the future."
1	"Of course, what you have learned in college is the most important for entering a company you want to join."
1	"But after entering, you may utilize what you have learned in a part-time job."
1	"If you don't have those experiences, you can't cope with many kinds of work or problems, for example, how to communicate with older or younger people or solve some accidents that you don't expect to happen but that, if you have experience, you can act in quickly and flexibly."
1	"Part-time jobs have these good sides, so college students should work, if they don't forget to study."
1	"I agree with the opinion."
1	"And I have four reasons why I agree with it."
1	"First, college students have many things to do, to have to do, and to buy."
1	"And money is essential for doing those things."
1	"If we have money, we can join some parties and we can meet many interesting persons."
1	"If we have money, we can purchase a lot of books, which are useful for our studying."
1	"Second, by doing a part-time job, we can learn many things that we cannot experience in college days, and can make friends who are learning a different category of study."
1	"By experiencing new things, we can see the world that we do not know, and we can do new things that we could not do."
1	"By making friends, we can share great times with them."
1	"Third, to have a place where we can spend time easily is important."
1	"If we lose a place where we can spend time easily in college, a part-time job can be an oasis."
1	"We do not have to adjust ourselves unnaturally to a situation where we do not belong."
1	"Fourth, and most important, we may meet a person whom we will marry in the future."
1	"Consequently, I agree with the opinion."
1	"I agree with this opinion."
1	"There are several reasons."
1	"First, we can experience how to work."
1	"Most of us haven't worked in high school, so I think we don't know how to speak and how to act in the working place."
1	"Thanks to a part-time job, we can know such things, and we become familiar with working."
1	"Second, we can earn money."
1	"Needless to say, it is very important for college students to earn money, especially for living alone."
1	"We spend a lot of money, so we need as much money as possible."
1	"Third, we can make friends."
1	"There are many people in the working place, so we can be on good terms with them."
1	"However, I don't have any part-time job now."
1	"I'm too busy to have a part-time job."
1	"We college students have a lot of things to do."
1	"We should have a driver's license, study hard, do club activities, and so on."
1	"In addition, I'm not familiar with my college, so I am going to have a part-time job after summer vacation."
1	"I am going to teach junior high school students."
1	"However hard it is for us to have a part-time job, it will help us get a job in the future."
1	"I think that I can know about myself by having a part-time job, and thanks to it, I will find my job in the future."
1	"I disagree with this statement, because I think that college students are coming to college to study advanced things that they don't know yet or that they need in the future, so they have to concentrate on studying."
1	"I worry that the part-time jobs prevent them from studying at college."
1	"I think if they start to do part-time jobs, they need more and more time than when they were high school students."
1	"Then they probably eliminate the time to study or sleep in order to do the part-time jobs."
1	"I also think doing part-time jobs is good for them from the view of being members of society."
1	"But as you know, less sleeping tires them and makes them always sleepy, but if you are a tough guy or girl, it means nothing."
1	"If you are sleepy during lessons at college, it means nothing to study at college."
1	"I think if they want to study difficult and advanced things that they don't know yet, they need much time and power to study hard and the time to sleep that keeps them well."
1	"Therefore, I think having part-time jobs is not so good for college students."
1	"I agree that college students should have a part-time job."
1	"I think that college is not only a place where we study but also where we make humanity."
1	"Humanity is made when we have communication."
1	"And a part-time job is a good chance to have communication."
1	"So I agree with a part-time job."
1	"However, there are many kinds of part-time jobs."
1	"Not all part-time jobs have a good effect on us."
1	"So we have to choose a part-time job carefully."
1	"I think that there are three conditions of a good part-time job."
1	"First is money."
1	"Most of us have a part-time job to get money."
1	"If we can get a lot of money, we will call it a good job."
1	"Second is the kind of work colleagues."
1	"Good communication requires good members."
1	"If there are people who don't have humanity, probably you are unwilling to be concerned with them."
1	"As a result, you can't have communication."
1	"Third is job profile."
1	"It is important that we choose a job that we can use to our advantage."
1	"For example, people who are good at communication should choose jobs that have many communications."
1	"And it is also good for people who are poor at it to choose such jobs as practice."
1	"In the end, the experiences of a part-time job have a good effect on us."
1	"So college students should have a part-time job."
1	"I agree with this statement."
1	"I have some reasons."
1	"First, it is important for college students to learn working because I think this experience is useful in the future."
1	"For example, they can learn manners and skill."
1	"Second, in a part-time job you can meet a lot of people."
1	"They are different from your college friends."
1	"Some are fellow workers."
1	"You may meet the best friend of your life."
1	"Or you may get a boyfriend or girlfriend."
1	"Others are customers."
1	"If you give them good service, they return a smile."
1	"But if you give them bad service, they may be angry."
1	"I am sure that these meetings make your mind grow."
1	"Third, it is important for college students to bring in a salary in a part-time job."
1	"I think college students need some money because college students spend a lot of money to play with friends, to live, and so on."
1	"And saving money for the future is important, too."
1	"If you bring some money from your father or mother, you should stop it because you should learn how to use money by yourself."
1	"Otherwise, you will have trouble in the future."
1	"This is why I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
1	"Currently, many students have obtained part-time jobs so they can pay for college tuition."
1	"This can be difficult."
1	"However, some students have to work, especially private school students."
1	"I think it is important for us however there are many shortages."
1	"First, our most important task as students is studying."
1	"We can always obtain part-time jobs."
1	"Yet, we might not always have the opportunity to study."
1	"For example, consider a student who waited too long to begin studying."
1	"This student believed his/her part-time job was more important than studying."
1	"He/she did not reserve enough time to study properly."
1	"This example demonstrates that part-time jobs are not as important as studying."
1	"Second, if students work part-time, they might not be able to concentrate in class."
1	"In general, part-time jobs begin in the evening and end late at night."
1	"Students may strugle to pay attention in class when they are tired and sleepy."
1	"For example, I worked for a night delivery service between 10:00 in the evening and 6:00 in the morning."
1	"Initially, this schedule was very difficult to maintain."
1	"Before I adapted to the time changes, I slept during classes."
1	"This shows how part-time jobs can disturb a student's ability to concentrate in class."
1	"Many news reports have stated that part-time jobs are becoming social problems."
1	"Therefore, the Government has adopted a wise policy."
1	"It recommends that students concentrate on their studies."
1	"This problem can only be resolved by the Government because it is a  hot potato"" for college students."
1	"We must study to succeed in the future."
1	"Part-time jobs can prevent our future success."
1	"I agree that college students should have part-time jobs."
1	"Such jobs tend to make students more independent."
1	"A critical issue faced by many college students today is difficulty in paying their tuition fees."
1	"Through part-time jobs, students can earn money for themselves and also have a variety of experiences."
1	"Anxiety about earing money is neutral, and if you have too much free time, you could lose money."
1	"Most importantly, you need a part-time job, because otherwise, you will have little social experience."
1	"Part-time jobs of students include cashier jobs, and it is easy to understand why students take up these jobs as they help students make money and also have social experiences."
1	"If you are considering getting a part-time job in a few months, I just want to say that it will be good to further your career."
1	"Typically your studies at college are related to your future work."
1	"You may happen to get a decent side income by doing a part-time job."
1	"You can also learn the trends related to your future work."
1	"Your part-time job experiences may be a kind of guideline for you as you progress in life."
1	"In the future, you may have to write a resume for yourself and also obtain certificates and recommendation letters."
1	"If you have a good experience with your part-time job, it will help you do well in the future."
1	"I agree that college students should have part-time jobs."
1	"If college students obtain part-time jobs, they can improve their social skills."
1	"College students who work part-time can improve their social skills earlier than students who do not work."
1	"Students who work part-time will learn to adapt more easily."
1	"In addition, college students can earn their own money."
1	"They will not need their parents' help."
1	"Students will learn that it can be difficult to earn money."
1	"They will learn the value of money and not spend it so easily."
1	"They can also reduce their parents' financial worries."
1	"Students who work part-time can make more friends."
1	"They can meet many people at their jobs."
1	"They can improve their communication skills."
1	"Communication skills are very important life skills."
1	"Part-time jobs offer college students many benefits."
1	"They can increase their experience if they can find jobs that relate to their majors."
1	"College students who work part-time must not disrupt their studies."
1	"However, overall, I believe part-time jobs are important for college students' future success."
1	"It's important for college students to have part-time jobs."
1	"I agree with this statement."
1	"To be honest, I am in favor of this opinion, because I need a job to earn money for dating."
1	"But it is also important for university students to learn the value of money and take their future seriously."
1	"In some cases, it is considered a prerequisite for college students to work part-time."
1	"However, if you focus only on your part-time job rather than on your study, you could go wrong, so be careful."
1	"Though I really do not know  much about this subject, students facing economic difficulties at home should have a part-time job."
1	"When I entered college, I was very excited, and I wanted to have a part-time job so that I could learn better social etiquette."
1	"By getting a part-time job, we can learn about how the society works and how we can get along with our bosses."
1	"Smiling is important when you do a part-time job."
1	"Cheerful people always leave a good impression, and learning the spirit of service will help you find a job in the future."
1	"Let me finish here on this subject."
1	"I believe that it is good for university students to have a part-time job."
1	"This experience may help you for the rest of your life."
1	"I had my first part-time job during my freshman year at university."
1	"During the summer, I wanted to earn money and travel all over the world."
1	"I found an apartment and secured a part-time sales job."
1	"My first sales deal was very tough, because I had an introverted personality."
1	"The management wanted powerful salespeople."
1	"After about two weeks, I lost my job."
1	"I obtained my second part-time job at a very popular bar."
1	"The work was very easy."
1	"I had the job for two months, and I celebrated that summer after two semesters at the university."
1	"I had to perform kitchen work, and my boss was very nice."
1	"All I needed to do was serve the dishes in a good manner."
1	"When we had many customers, however, we were really busy."
1	"We could not rest at all and could not even breathe."
1	"But such times did not last long."
1	"The conditions of that part-time job were not bad."
1	"I now feel that it was the best part-time job I've had so far."
1	"I believe part-time jobs are good for college students for the following reasons."
1	"First, we can earn our own money."
1	"We can use the money we earn to buy food, shop, or enjoy ourselves."
1	"In addition, I can help my mother pay my university registration fees."
1	"If I save money every month, I will have enough money buy my parents' birthday gifts."
1	"I will not be dependent on my parents."
1	"I will grow up."
1	"Currently, university fees are very expensive."
1	"Therefore, college students must obtain part-time jobs."
1	"Second, part-time jobs can improve our social skills."
1	"We can learn how to interact in companies and how to interact with our bosses."
1	"In addition, we can make friends at work."
1	"Many people graduate without having gained any social experience."
1	"This can cause problems in the workplace."
1	"A person must be courageous to face his/her boss because a boss can fire an employee."
1	"We can make friends while we attend school."
1	"However, if we have part-time jobs, we can make more friends at work who can teach us how to work efficiently."

2	"It is very important for college students to have part-time jobs for a variety of reasons."
2	"Most college students are already eighteen years old."

2	"College students should work hard to become independent and not remain dependent on their parents."
2	"The best way to become independent is to earn money."

2	"In addition, when college students have part-time jobs, they can develop their abilities and build good foundations for future employment."
2	"We all know that experience is very important when we apply for jobs."

2	"Other people believe part-time jobs are a waste of time."
2	"They believe part-time jobs offer more disadvantages than advantages to college students."
2	"In my opinion, this argument has two sides."
2	"Even though part-time jobs can create problems for college students, they still provide important benefits."
2	"First, part-time jobs provide college students with opportunities to connect with society."
2	"Students will learn the latest news and become aware of hot topics in the talent market."
2	"They will be better prepared for their future careers."
2	"For example, a college student who works part-time as an office clerk will learn how to behave and what to do when he/she is faced with a complicated work situation."

2	"Many college students are only children."
2	"They can be too dependent on their parents and teachers."

2	"Therefore, I believe part-time jobs are good for college students and I support them!"
2	"If an individual has extra time available after his or her work or school ends, that individual can obtain another type of job, known as a part-time job."

2	"Part-time employment can enrich college students' experience and widen their horizons."
2	"On occasion, part-time jobs can offer special opportunities such as love and life-long friendships."

2	"The student may have not time to rest."
2	"In addition, a part-time job can be stressful because a student must perform well on the job."
2	"Ultimately, a part-time job is just a part-time job."
2	"A student can choose to work part-time depending on his or her situation."
2	"Yet, a part-time job offers a good opportunity for a student to challenge him/herself and earn pocket money."

2	"Access to some income may encourage us to fight for our futures."
2	"Everyone hopes to succeed in life."
2	"Based on the reasons I listed above, undoubtedly, it is important for students to have part-time jobs."

2	"When I first attended university, I discovered  that many students held part-time jobs."
2	"I wanted to know why most college students were eager to find part-time jobs."
2	"I have listed my opinions below."
2	"First, part-time jobs can offer us opportunities to learn skills we cannot learn at school."
2	"If we can obtain part-time jobs, such as restaurant waiter or shop assistant positions, we might have more chances to learn how to interact with guests."
2	"We will gain experience that may help us find jobs after we graduate from school."
2	"Second, because we must spend time at our part-time jobs, we will have to learn how to manage our time."
2	"It is commonly known that many college students believe college life is very boring because they attend fewer classes than they attended in high school."
2	"If we can find part-time jobs, we will never feel bored."

2	"An old saying states,'Practice is the sole criterion one can use to test the truth.'"
2	"College can be considered a bridge that connects schools with society."
2	"We are expected to work after we graduate."
2	"First, we can increase our knowledge and accumulate additional social experiences during part-time employment that differ from knowledge we learn from books."
2	"In addition, when we have part-time jobs, we can improve our social skills."
2	"When we interact in society, we must form relationships with different people."
2	"During part-time employment, we may experience social difficulties."
2	"However, we can also make more friends at our part-time jobs."
2	"Many of my friends have worked in part-time positions, such as waiter, postman, and tutor."
2	"All of my friends are excited about their work."

2	"In addition, part-time jobs help us gain important work experiences."
2	"After all, when we attend job interviews after graduation, we will have to answer the question,  Do you have work experience?"""
2	"Some people might believe, in many cases, that college students are employed in jobs that are not related to their majors."
2	"They believe that these types of jobs will not help students obtain future employment."
2	"However, are interviewers only interested in major job experience?"
2	"I do not believe this is true."
2	"In my opinion, experiences in which students can interact with society are quite valuable."
2	"If students can enter society earlier than usual, they can gain a better understanding of society's complexity."
2	"This will help them perform better in their future careers."
2	"Most students feel college life is more relaxed than high-school life."
2	"An increasing number of students are becoming addicted to computer games during their college years."
2	"If they had part-time jobs, they could improve their time management skills."

2	"Currently, it is popular for college students to seek part-time jobs."
2	"Students should obtain part-time jobs for a number of obvious reasons."
2	"I have outlined my views below."
2	"First, when society and the economy began to develop, tuition increased rapidly."
2	"Students who work part-time can pay some of their living expenses and reduce their families' financial burdens."
2	"Second, students can improve their communication and problem-solving skills."
2	"These skills will be useful during future job searches."
2	"They are also important during students' daily lives."
2	"Third, students who work part-time can make friends outside of school in their workplaces."
2	"These older friends can provide students with advice that will be useful for work and daily life."
2	"Students and their same-age friends can learn from one another and exchange class-related information."
2	"Finally, part-time employment can increase students' work experience."
2	"Once college students graduate, they can include these work experiences in their employment applications and improve their chances to gain employment."
2	"It is widely known that college students who are employed part-time enjoy many advantages."
2	"We should encourage college students to obtain part-time jobs!"
2	"I believe it is very important for college students to obtain part-time jobs."
2	"As undergraduates, we are learning additional knowledge and techniques that will help us obtain better positions in the future."
2	"However, reality might not be what we imagine it will be."
2	"To achieve our dreams, we need both experience and skills."
2	"We can benefit greatly from part-time jobs."
2	"First, although many of us can become overwhelmed by our courses, regular tasks can help us maintain a good balance between work and play."
2	"Part-time jobs can help us establish good work habits that will contribute to our personal development."
2	"Although we might make errors, as good learners we realize that errors are a constructive part of the learning process."

2	"We may have to adjust our strategies when we determine our future directions."
2	"Further, part-time jobs provide opportunities to practice our communication skills."
2	"We must develop good interpersonal relationships to succeed in society."
2	"The social skills we develop during part-time work are vital."
2	"We can learn how to get along with other people."
2	"Some people believe that individuals who have work experience are better at controlling interview anxiety."
2	"One particular reason why we should obtain part-time jobs is that we have limited funds."
2	"We all hope to become independent when we become adults."
2	"Therefore, we may be reluctant to accept money from our parents."
2	"Part-time jobs offer us additional benefits and they help relieve our economic pressures."
2	"Whether we hope to become lawyers, businessmen, or officials, social skills practice is important."
2	"We cannot avoid contact with society."
2	"Part-time jobs provide opportunities to interact with the real world."
2	"It is commonly known that some college students are employed in or are looking for part-time jobs such as waiters, leafleteers, shop assistants, and so on."
2	"Some people believe this is important."
2	"However, other people believe this is a just a waste of time."
2	"Personally, I don't think some people believe part-jobs are worthwhile for college students."
2	"First, it is obvious that we will have more money when we have part-jobs than we would have if we didn't take these jobs."
2	"We are not middle- or high-school students."
2	"Rather, we are college students who are entering adulthood."
2	"The time has arrived when we must earn some money."
2	"If we earn money, we can reduce the heavy burdens our parents carry on their weakening shoulders."
2	"Second, part-time employment can improve our knowledge and abilities."
2	"Perhaps money is not so important for some individuals."
2	"However, abilities are necessities that will be required by all types of jobs in the future."
2	"For example, good communication skills are important in all types of situations."
2	"Because college students have more free time, I believe part-time job employment can enrich their university lives."
2	"Just compare what we learn when we play computer games and surf the Internet and what we can achieve from meaningful part-time jobs."
2	"Overall, I believe it is important and necessary to obtain part-time jobs."
2	"Once we passed the horrific college entrance examinations, we, 17- or18-year-old boys and girls, arrived on campus."
2	"The world seemed open to us."
2	"Everything attracted our interest."
2	"School activities were better than we had ever imagined they could be."
2	"Our lives were filled with happiness."
2	"However, when we look back now, we realize we should gain more experience and learn different things during our college years."
2	"In addition, an increasing number of companies are paying close attention to social skills."
2	"Therefore, part-time employment has become very popular among college students."
2	"Why is it so important?"
2	"First, students can increase their knowledge through part-time employment."
2	"For example, if a student who is majoring in education obtains a part-time job in a school, he or she will gain a better understanding of facts that appear in books."
2	"In addition, that student will have opportunities that extend beyond what can be learned in class."
2	"The student will learn information that can only be learned in practice."
2	"In addition, a student can develop talents in other areas."
2	"Finally, a student can discover his or her sense of self-worth and develop future job search skills."
2	"A student can apply what he or she learns during part-time employment in a future full-time job."
2	"This will help the student succeed."
2	"A student will also learn that it can be difficult to earn money."
2	"A student may also learn to remain simple and humble."
2	"I believe more students should obtain part-time jobs because they are important and necessary. "
2	"I agree with this statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
2	"I think the best way to learn about money and society is to do a part-time job."
2	"In doing a part-time job, college students learn about money and society and understand how difficult earning money is."
2	"And college students learn things about society that are not taught in school."
2	"More and more college students are doing part-time jobs so that they are able to prepare for future life when they will work for their families."
2	"If college students don't have a part-time job and don't know what a life is, they have great difficulty in working."
2	"In college years, managers don't punish college students heavily if they make a mistake."
2	"But in a company, managers punish employees heavily."
2	"To get used to work and to earn money, college students need to do a part-time job."
2	"College students need to do a part-time job to know what a life is."
2	"So I agree with this statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
2	"I disagree with that opinion."
2	"I think that it is not important for college students to have a part-time job."
2	"There are two main reasons."
2	"The first reason is that students should study."
2	"What students have to do is study, but some students can't study enough because of their part-time job."
2	"For example, my friend has a part-time job teaching English to elementary school students."
2	"She looks so busy everyday preparing for teaching."
2	"She often checks students' answers on examinations even during a class in the university."
2	"Also, she is likely to be late for a class because she has to prepare all night for teaching."
2	"I can't think it is good for her."
2	"In her case, a part-time job prevents her from studying."
2	"The second reason is that many students spend most of their salary playing, not living."
2	"They mainly spend their money on clothes, their hobby, dating, traveling, and so on."
2	"This means most of them don't work for a living."
2	"For instance, my friend whom I mentioned above is one of such students."
2	"She lives with her family and doesn't have to work."
2	"However, she wants to get more clothes and to follow fashion."
2	"In closing, I don't want to say students must not have part-time jobs, but it is not so important for them."
2	"Therefore, I think it is unimportant for college students to have a part-time job."
2	"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
2	"I have three reasons to support my stance."
2	"First, a part-time job is an important chance to experience society."
2	"Because a college is the place to prepare before going into the real society, a part-time job is very necessary to know how severe working is or how we can enjoy it."
2	"In my experience, I learned through working in a bakery that even one mistake cannot be allowed in a service."
2	"I also noticed the importance of the relationship with my seniors."
2	"The second reason is a monetary problem."
2	"I think college students need a lot of money for textbooks or for some entertainment."
2	"However, we are already adults and should not totally depend on our parents in finance."
2	"Therefore it is quite better to earn by ourselves as much as possible."
2	"As for me, I can live without working if I ask my parents to support me, but I chose to work."
2	"That's because I have to learn to manage myself before graduating from university."
2	"After I started to work, I actually came to think about the importance of money when I buy something."
2	"Lastly, I think a part-time job is a good opportunity to make new friends."
2	"In a college, it is difficult to find so many kinds of friends because ages and departments are limited."
2	"However, if we work, we can meet any kind of people, regardless of age or specialty."
2	"I think such relationships are precious even after getting older."
2	"For all those reasons, I strongly believe that having a part-time job is important for college students."
2	"I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
2	"Of course, I have a part-time job."
2	"A part-time job must be a valuable experience."
2	"Many high school students are banned from having a part-time job."
2	"Even if they want to work, their parents and teachers forbid it."
2	"But college students are free to work and have a lot of time."
2	"They should have a part-time job unless they are absent from class because of it."
2	"Through a part-time job, I learned the difficulty of earning."
2	"Therefore, I learned to use money very carefully."
2	"This is an important thing in my life."
2	"Some people who do not have a part-time job when they are college students will not know the difficulty until they get a job."
2	"That is too late."
2	"People are not apt to forget things that they learned when they were young."
2	"My mother said it is very valuable for young people to experience trouble."
2	"So, we should experience many things and get a correct view, the right way to think and so on."
2	"They who have acquired them will live comfortably from now on."
2	"A great life waits for them."
2	"I agree with this statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
2	"I have two reasons."
2	"As the first, many college students don't have money but they need much money for their food, clothing and shelter, playing with their friends, going anywhere, and buying anything that they want."
2	"But when they use their money to buy something, their parents don't always give money to them."
2	"So they need to have a part-time job."
2	"By working, they can get some money, as well as experience selling products and services, and learn the difficulties in earning money."
2	"That is the first reason."
2	"The second reason is that the wage for college students is cheaper than for other workers."
2	"So if college students work part-time, many companies and shops avoid paying higher wages to employees."
2	"But now the condition of business is very bad in Japan."
2	"Some people think because of college students' part-time work, many unemployed people miss their opportunities to work and the unemployment rate is high."
2	"Certainly the number of people in the workforce doesn't include college students and the part-time work by college students causes a rise in the unemployment rate."
2	"But it is said that business in the world is the worst in a hundred years."
2	"So when business gets good, the unemployed people now will be able to get their work and the unemployed people will be fewer than now."
2	"By college students' working part-time, many companies and shops can decrease the payment of employees' wages."
2	"So I agree with the statement."
2	"I agree with this statement."
2	"Now I am a third-year student of a university."
2	"When I entered the university, I had to have a part-time job because of needing money."
2	"If I do not work, I cannot have fun in my college life; for example, drinking, traveling, and buying clothes are impossible."
2	"If you want to enjoy your college life, money is really one of the essential things."
2	"That is why it is very important for college students to have a part-time job."
2	"By the way, I am sure that you can gain and learn a lot of things if you have a part-time job."
2	"In a part-time job, you can see a lot of kinds of people, for example, other university students and regular workers there."
2	"By communicating with such kinds of people, you can learn and be stimulated by them and possibly make friends with them."
2	"And also you can experience first-hand what it feels like to work in a society."
2	"When you become a third-year student, you usually do job hunting."
2	"If you work at a part-time job, you can talk with regular workers and see a real work place and also notice the difficulty of working."
2	"In that way, experiencing a part-time job helps you in job hunting."
2	"That is why I strongly believe that it is really important for college students to have a part-time job."
2	"I agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
2	"I want to explain the two reasons I think that college students should have a part-time job."
2	"The first reason is that college students should really know the value and difficulties of getting money."
2	"People need money for living."
2	"A lot of money is needed for one person to be grown up."
2	"Basically, college students depend on their parents, especially for money."
2	"But most students don't know their parents' hard work to get so much money for their children."
2	"I think they should know how hard work is needed for getting just a little money through a part-time job, and understand the effort their parents put in."
2	"Next, what I want to tell you for the second reason is that college students can learn about society through a part-time job."
2	"Common sense as working people is really essential for business, for instance, how to communicate with other people in business and how to talk."
2	"A part-time job could be the only place that students can learn about society as working adults."
2	"Students can communicate with working people in a part-time job to learn."
2	"For these two reasons, I agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
2	"I agree with this statement."
2	"I think having a part-time job is important for college students."
2	"I have two reasons."
2	"First, thanks to a part-time job, students can earn money by themselves."
2	"For an ordinary family, college fees are very expensive."
2	"And if students are living alone, much money is needed."
2	"So by doing a part-time job, they can help their family."
2	"Moreover, even for students in a rich family, earning money is important because by using that money they can do many things."
2	"For example, they can travel or study abroad."
2	"So in this way having a part-time job is beneficial for college students."
2	"Second, thanks to a part-time job, students have social experiences that they never learn in school."
2	"For example, in a food store or restaurant, they are taught manners and how to speak to customers politely."
2	"Such skills will be useful after they become working adults."
2	"Moreover, they can learn how hard working is."
2	"It is said that in these days young people soon quit their jobs, but if they know about working before they graduate from college, they can endure even if their work is hard."
2	"Therefore, I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
2	"I think it important for college students to have a part-time job."
2	"I have two reasons for that."
2	"First, they need money."
2	"It costs a lot of money to enter a university."
2	"Of course, it is not they, but their parents, that paid the money."
2	"I believe they should pay back the money, more or less, to their parents, and some students want to go to a graduate school."
2	"In addition, generally, college students spend much money, for example, money for buying nice clothes or shoes, hanging out with one's friends, and playing club activities."
2	"For another reason, they can learn how the society is."
2	"Part-time jobs enable them to learn how to make good relations with other members or their boss."
2	"They attain kinds of skills and learn how strict and severe rules are."
2	"They will also learn how difficult it is to make money."
2	"You may say that if you work at a part-time job too hard, it causes bad effects to your study in university."
2	"It is true, but actually students have the right and they can control their own shift to some extent."
2	"If they want to earn a lot of money in a short time, they should work as a cram school teacher."
2	"Besides, I have a lot of friends who work really hard and have great school records."
2	"That is why having a part-time job is necessary for college students."
2	"I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
2	"I have some reasons to follow this idea."
2	"First, a part-time job is good training of real work for college students."
2	"College students have to work after they graduate from their college."
2	"Then, the experience of a part-time job will help them."
2	"For example, if they work in an office, they can learn skill in using computers."
2	"Second, a part-time job also gives students social experiences."
2	"Students learn how they should act in the society."
2	"For example, if the students work as waiters or waitresses, they can learn polite words and good manners."
2	"It will help them when they are given an interview or entrance examination to get a job."
2	"And, of course, the company they will join will benefit as well."
2	"Third, most students do part-time jobs because they can earn money with a part-time job."
2	"They can use that money as they want."
2	"For some students, that is the first money they earn all by themselves."
2	"They can learn the value of the money they use, too."
2	"They can also learn how hard it will be to earn money and live in the future."
2	"For those reasons, I think that having a part-time job is important for college students."
2	"I think it is important to have a part-time job."
2	"Most high school students are not allowed to work, but college students are allowed to do so."
2	"A lot of students around me are working."
2	"Mainly, they work for their living."
2	"Most of them still depend on money that their parents send."
2	"So, they want to reduce their parents' burden."
2	"Also, college students have many opportunities to eat out and go shopping, and therefore they want to have money that they can use freely."
2	"Besides, there are many reasons for students to work."
2	"In fact, there are many good things about having a part-time job."
2	"First, through a job, they can have a lot of experiences."
2	"For example, I experienced the difficulties of communicating with customers and of standing still for six hours without taking a break."
2	"I felt it was too hard to earn money."
2	"I thanked my father for his working hard every day."
2	"Second, by saving their salary, they can do more things than they ever did before."
2	"They can go abroad or buy what they want."
2	"Finally, they come to know the responsibility that is needed in society."
2	"Their experiences will be a key to their future."
2	"Therefore I truly think it is essential for college students to have a part-time job."
2	"I agree with the statement."
2	"There are several reasons for my idea."
2	"First of all, I think that college students should not only study subjects that they are specializing in, but also do many kinds of things outside of college."
2	"That is because they can experience various things through such events, for example, travel abroad, joining a club, doing volunteer work, and having a part-time job."
2	"I think that when they have a part-time job, they can learn the mechanism of society and acquire a lot of skills."
2	"The knowledge and many skills they get through a part-time job will help them in the future."
2	"Secondly, college students should earn their money and they should be independent of their parents."
2	"In Japan these days, the number of children is decreasing and more and more college students depend on their parents too much."
2	"I hear that in America, college students earn their own money to pay all the money that is needed in college."
2	"If college students continue to depend on their parents, they will be in trouble in the future."
2	"Therefore, I think that college students should be independent of their parents."
2	"So I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
2	"I think that it is good for students of a university to have a part-time job."
2	"I have three reasons for this."
2	"First, it is a good opportunity to think how to work in the future."
2	"We can learn the way to speak or act."
2	"And we can understand how important working is."
2	"These days, many students are described like this:  They don't think seriously about their future."""
2	"So, I think that trying to join a job is very important for students of a university."
2	"Second, we can meet a lot of people through a part-time job."
2	"Actually, I have a part-time job as a waitress in a restaurant."
2	"Through my job, I have been able to meet various people, such as students of other universities, the chef, and customers."
2	"Meeting many people and knowing various ways of thinking is really a precious experience for me."
2	"I think that it is the same for other students."
2	"Third, having a part-time job will lead people to recognize the importance of money."
2	"Before I started to work, I didn't care about money."
2	"But when I earn money, I really understand how important it is."
2	"It may lead students to stop to wasting money."
2	"For these reasons, if a student knows well the importance of studying and is good at using time, it is good for him or her to have a part-time job."
2	"I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
2	"Of course, it isn't the most important thing to do that."
2	"That is because we should go to college to study something interesting for us and we should start having a full-time job at once if we think making money is most important."
2	"I think experiencing a part-time job is good unless our studying has a bad result."
2	"By having a part-time job, we can communicate with people we can't talk with in our usual college life."
2	"That experience is useful now, not only in our future."
2	"Now, I teach some subjects in the cram school where I went in my high school days."
2	"I talk with my students and other teachers, not only about studies, but also anything else."
2	"The people vary in age from young to elderly, so their ideas are very different."
2	"I can get a lot of views."
2	"My senior has a part-time job at an old people's home."
2	"He supports the residents' life and talks with them."
2	"They sometimes forget who he is and repeat the same story to him."
2	"But he told me that their peculiar atmosphere and their figures thank many people sent him."
2	"We can't have such experiences when we only go to college, so I think having a part-time job is important for college students."
2	"I agree with this idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
2	"Unlike high school students, college students must learn and study more voluntarily and harder."
2	"Also, they have to learn about real society and go outside the college."
2	"To do so, a part-time job is one of the most reasonable means."
2	"In fact, almost all of them think about their future, for example, job, their own family, and death, more seriously."
2	"I have spent every day alone since I entered college, and I'm poorer than if I lived in my hometown."
2	"I have a part-time job so that I can live by myself."
2	"As you know when you work, there are a lot of things that we should learn."
2	"For instance, we are supposed to learn the way of communicating with others and to have more responsibilities than ever."
2	"My friend, Takeru, lives alone and makes a living by himself."
2	"In spite of this lifestyle, he has a very great record and belongs to the tennis club."
2	"I respect him so much as my good friend, and also he gives nice advice that will surely be useful in my future."
2	"For these reasons, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
2	"I disagree with this opinion."
2	"I think it unimportant for college students to have a part-time job (but I don't think that it is completely unimportant)."
2	"The reason I think so is that college students' job is doing something they can only do when they are in college, so I think that."
2	"For example, for math, they can rarely have the time to study it when they are working."
2	"And not only some school subjects, but also a sports club activity is important for them, because it may be hard but they can do their best when they have too-high obstacles."
2	"But some disagree with my opinion and think it important for them to have a part-time job for learning society or some other reasons."
2	"But I think that society can be learned when they are in a sports club or cultural club and so on."
2	"And the biggest reason is that they have to study or get good grades and be a person who contributes to society, such as a good engineer or translator or economist."
2	"I think that it is difficult for them to do perfectly both a part-time job and getting good grades."
2	"So those are some reasons that I think that it is unimportant to have a part-time job for them."
2	"I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
2	"I want to show some reasons why I agree."
2	"First, simply, money is important."
2	"We need it in many situations."
2	"For example, we need to buy a lot of textbooks, tools for study, kinds of pens and erasers, something for a hobby or clubs, and so on."
2	"Do you know the price of those?"
2	"Those are so expensive!"
2	"So we have to have a part-time job."
2	"That's the first reason."
2	"Second, it's good for us to learn about the public."
2	"At the place where we are working, there are many adults, visitors, and so on."
2	"So we have to learn what to do there or how to do it."
2	"It's a good chance to learn before we belong to the society."
2	"That's the second reason."
2	"And third, we can know about the importance of money."
2	"I think that we can't understand it truly without working and earning by ourselves."
2	"If you do not know that, you are going to make mistakes about money or things like that."
2	"Therefore, we have to know the importance of money, and make an effort not to use money so much or not to use it with no plan or idea."
2	"These are why I agree to have a part-time job."
2	"I agree because I think that college students have much free time and energy."
2	"In addition, they think that the money is important but the effects of a part-time job are important."
2	"For example, students acquire communication and social ability and learn how important money is and how difficult getting money is."
2	"Colleges also advise students to have a part-time job."
2	"It is evidence that colleges also think having a part-time job is important."
2	"Actually, I have a part-time job four times a week and thirty-four hours in a month."
2	"And I realize what I want to do in the future and what kind of jobs aren't much for me."
2	"In other words, experiencing a part-time job helps college students select a lifetime job more smoothly."
2	"But having too many part-time jobs is not good for them."
2	"If students have too many, they probably can't study in college very well or don't attend their classes."
2	"Also, they might not be able to keep up with their friends in school if they have too many part-time jobs."
2	"As a result of that, they might need a few years longer to graduate or might not graduate."
2	"Another bad effect is that getting much money might make them forget the importance of money."
2	"But it is a very extreme instance, so the bad instance rarely occurs."
2	"First of all, I think it is really important for a student to experience what society's system is like."
2	"In fact, I've come to know there are strange people who are beyond my imagination by having a part-time job."
2	"And I have learned how to treat such annoying people."
2	"I think this skill is really important."
2	"Second, having a part-time job made me realize how hard earning money was."
2	"My mother always used to tell me,  You don't know the real worth of money,"" and now I can really understand my mother."
2	"It is impossible for me to quit spending money on worthless things, but I have come to be more careful than I was when I buy something."
2	"Third I think this is really a precious thing having a part-time job brings me the chance to know a lot of kinds of people that I would never know without a part-time job."
2	"I think having a lot of kinds of friends broadens my way of thinking and point of view."
2	"Actually, it was really interesting for me to work with my boss, who was dreaming of running his own restaurant."
2	"For these reasons I give, I think a college student should have a part-time job."
2	"I agree with the statement  It is important for college students to have a part-time job."""
2	"There are three reasons to support my answer."
2	"First, I don't have much money, so I cannot help needing to get some money by working."
2	"I recently moved to Kobe and live there by myself now."
2	"My mother always sends some money every month."
2	"But I must earn some money because there are too many things I want to buy."
2	"This is the first reason I have a part-time job."
2	"Second, it may be useful to have had a part-time job when I graduate from the university and work for a company."
2	"I will give an example."
2	"I worked at a convenience store during summer vacation last year."
2	"I worked hard, and I was able to learn consumers' needs and business skills in reception, hospitality, and so on through the job."
2	"That is why I understand the importance of a part-time job."
2	"Third, as I work, I get to discover the pleasure of a job."
2	"For example, I taught a high school student as a part-time job in September last year."
2	"He was poor at mathematics, so I kept teaching him mathematics."
2	"Fortunately, his grade became good."
2	"Then he said to me,  Thank you."""
2	"I was happy to hear that, and knew the fun of the job."
2	"That is why I support my answer."
2	"Therefore, I agree with the statement  It is important for college students to have a part-time job."""
2	"The original essay includes too many strange expressions and words and cannot be read appropriately."
2	"As the editor rejected processing the original, the project leader revised it after confirming the intention of the author, and the editor proofread that revised version."
2	"I believe college students should have part-time jobs."
2	"Currently, most students have part-time jobs because they are unable to survive on the pocket money their parents provide."
2	"Many students do not have enough money to attend university."
2	"Tuition is very expensive."
2	"Thus, students must obtain part-time jobs."
2	"If tuition was less expensive, students would not have to work part-time."
2	"However, because tuition is now so expensive, poorer students must work part-time."
2	"Part-time employment can improve students' independence."
2	"In addition, students can use the money they earn to buy things for themselves."
2	"Further, if a student hopes to open a store in the future, it would be helpful if that student worked part-time at a store."
2	"However, one disadvantage of part-time jobs is that they can increase stress."
2	"Students cannot earn a significant amount of money in a short amount of time."
2	"Finally, if a student has a dream for the future, it would be a good idea to choose the right type of part-time job."
2	"Then the student can gain experience so he/she can make his/her dream come true."
2	"Therefore, I believe it is important for college students to have part-time jobs."
2	"I completely agree that college students should obtain part-time jobs."
2	"I can provide four reasons to support my opinion."
2	"First, part-time jobs can help us gain more experience."
2	"For example, if I were to work in a convenience store, I could learn how to smile appealingly and learn to greet customers appropriately."
2	"If I were to work in a factory, I could learn to be more patient."
2	"I could also gain a better understanding of the way that factory makes appliances."
2	"Thus, we can gain a variety of experiences by working part-time."
2	"Second, it is possible to find part-time jobs that match our majors."
2	"For example, I work at an institute to earn money."
2	"Fortunately, I found a job teaching students."
2	"This helped me decide on my future career."
2	"Now I can work to achieve my dream."
2	"I will not have to search any further."
2	"Third, because I have a part-time job, I learned the value of money."
2	"Because I earn only a limited amount of money, I realized that money is valuable."
2	"Now I do not waste money."
2	"I try to save the money because I realize how difficult it is for my parents to earn money."
2	"Finally, Steve Jobs said, ""Connect the dots."""
2	"I believe my reasons demonstrate why my part-time job will help me in the future."
2	"Therefore, I believe college students should have part-time jobs."
2	"I believe it is important for college students to have part-time jobs."
2	"I can offer three reasons to support my opinion."
2	"First, part-time jobs can help students earn their livelihoods."
2	"Many students are struggling financially."
2	"It is impossible to stay energetic and remain alive without food."
2	"Second, students can improve their conversation skills when they work part-time."
2	"Social skills are very important."
2	"We must be able to communicate our needs to other people."
2	"It is better to learn these skills in real life."
2	"Part-time jobs can help us improve our abilities to communicate our needs."
2	"Third, some part-time jobs can help us with our college majors."
2	"It is a good idea to search for a part-time job that matches your major."
2	"For example, my major is English literature."
2	"I hope to find a part-time job that is related to English."
2	"This will help me improve my English and increase my skills."
2	"For the reasons listed above, I believe it is important for college students to have part-time jobs."
2	"I agree that college students should have part-time jobs."
2	"Many of my friends have part-time jobs."
2	"They often work near the university."
2	"They work part-time after their classes end."
2	"I have never had a part-time job."
2	"However, I believe college students should work, especially during school vacations."
2	"First, college students can learn the importance of money when they work part-time."
2	"They will learn that it is difficult to earn money."
2	"Rather than wasting money, they will save it."
2	"College students usually waste money on drinking and socializing."
2	"Second, students receive a great deal of money from their parents."
2	"In particular, registration fees are very expensive."
2	"Many parents pay these fees."
2	"If students can earn money for their personal expenses, parents will feel relieved."
2	"Therefore, students should earn their own money."
2	"Finally, students can gain priceless experience by working part-time."
2	"After they graduate from college, students will work at different companies."
2	"They may face many situations at work."
2	"If students have part-time jobs, they can gain experience before they obtain real jobs in the future."
2	"They can learn about their strengths and weaknesses."
2	"Therefore, I believe it is important for college students to have part-time jobs."
2	"Although I have never had a part-time job, I agree that it is important for college students to have part-time jobs for a number of reasons."
2	"First, most college students must spend huge amounts of money to pay university registration fees."
2	"The cost of registration fees is approaching 400-500 won."
2	"However, most students are unable to pay these fees."
2	"Thus, their parents must pay all of these costs."
2	"Part-time jobs can help students lighten their parents' financial burdens."
2	"Second, many companies expect students to have a great deal of work experience."
2	"Students who work part-time can gain a great deal of career experience."
2	"Third, students who work part-time can learn ways to interact with others."
2	"They can improve their social lives and develop character traits such as diligence, manners, and common sense."
2	"They can learn to form partnerships."
2	"For these reasons, I believe college students should have part-time jobs."
2	"Some people believe part-time jobs can disturb students' studying."
2	"Therefore, students who work part-time must learn to manage their time."
2	"Students must become stronger."
2	"Currently, many college students tend to live at home."
2	"They chose not to obtain part-time jobs because they want to devote themselves to self-improvement."
2	"Of course, this means they have a great deal of time they can devote to self-improvement."
2	"However, I agree that college students should have part-time jobs for the following reasons."
2	"First, college students must develop a sense of independence."
2	"For example, they should perform difficult tasks for a month so they can earn money."
2	"These efforts will provide encouragement and foster their independence."
2	"In addition, a survey conducted by the student council revealed that students who worked part-time were about four times more independent than students who did not work part-time."
2	"Second, college students who work part-time can pay their own school expenses."
2	"According to a survey conducted by a civic organization, seventy percent of all college students pay their registration fees in installments with money they earn during school vacations."
2	"Third, college students who work part-time can become more organized."
2	"They can learn useful information."
2	"A report stated that employees who worked part-time in the past quickly adjusted to new environments in comparison with employees who had not worked part-time in the past."
2	"Further, college students who work part-time  can learn methods they can use for future job searches."
2	"Therefore, I strongly agree that college students should have part-time jobs because these jobs foster a sense of independence, help students pay school expenses, and increase students' adaptability."
2	"I totally agree that college students should have part-time jobs."
2	"I can list some reasons to support my opinion."
2	"First, part-time jobs can help college students pay their own tuition."
2	"For example, one of my college friends has a part-time job to help pay her tuition."
2	"When she finishes school, she immediately travels to her part-time job."
2	"Second, part-time jobs provide opportunities to gain experience before we find our future careers."
2	"For example, many college students are unsure about what jobs they would like to have when they graduate college."
2	"Students who work part-time can decide on their future careers."
2	"Third, part-time jobs can help college students improve their social skills."
2	"Of course, they can socialize while they are in college."
2	"However, this is not sufficient."
2	"I believe students should meet many kinds of people throughout their lifetimes."
2	"Therefore, they can meet many kinds of people when they have part-time jobs."
2	"For those reasons, I believe it is important for college students to have part-time jobs."
2	"I agree that it is important for college students to have part-time jobs."
2	"I can list many reasons to support my opinion."
2	"Most college students do not live at home."
2	"Rather, they live near their colleges."
2	"This costs a great deal of money."
2	"Naturally, this way of life imposes heavy burdens on their parents."
2	"College offers many opportunities."
2	"If students can obtain part-time jobs, they can reduce their parents' burdens."
2	"Students can gain more experience."
2	"They can find part-time employment in a number of fields and meet many different people in a variety of work environments."
2	"I believe this is very important."
2	"In addition, working part-time can help students understand economic activities."
2	"Students must learn to manage and spend their income."
2	"Initially, these tasks might be difficult."
2	"However, over time, they will become easier."
2	"Part-time jobs can help students improve their social skills."
2	"I believe part-time jobs have many benefits."
2	"Students should not waste time."
2	"Students should obtain part-time jobs."
2	"I recommend that students visit the library and go to work."
2	"Students should not study all the time."
2	"Part-time employment is better than spending time in the library because part-time jobs offer students many opportunities."
2	"I firmly believe that work can be difficult but students will not be disappointed. "
2	"In my opinion, given the prevalent problems with the economy, college students should have work part-time."
2	"This is an important matter because it is difficult for many families to earn a huge amount to pay the college tuition fees for their children."
2	"It is difficult to earn money, and students require money during most of the school year."
2	"I have a part-time job along with school because I have to earn the fees."
2	"It is really difficult, but I have tried earnestly, believing in the  chance of success."
2	"It is also important for students to have part-time jobs because they can learn how to treat people around them."
2	"They can just write to their parents and inform them."
2	"After graduating from university, students want to be employed."
2	"However, in today's tough situation, it is like jumping on wires."
2	"Based on the things I mentioned above, it seems to be important to work hard and be successful."
2	"Many students attending high schools and vocational high schools work part-time and study at the same time, but they need to consider their futures."
2	"Otherwise, it will be more difficult for them to succeed."
2	"Even if students' families are in poverty and if they wish their families were wealthier, those working part-time should seriously think about the future."
2	"Currently, most college students have part-time jobs."
2	"Some have jobs because their families are in difficult circumstances."
2	"Others have jobs for family reasons."
2	"Some students must have jobs because college tuition is very expensive."
2	"Part-time jobs also provide very important job experience."
2	"If students only work part-time to earn money, their lives can be very difficult."
2	"However, many students take part-time employment to pay tuition or gain experience."
2	"They learn life lessons and have experiences that are more valuable than money."
2	"I also believe college tuition is too expensive."
2	"College students who lack money may not enjoy studying."
2	"Because part-time job maybe Study could reduce the time to be sold on."
2	"If so, we have unlimited potential to find a student fails."
2	"I think part-time jobs are important because they help students grow mentally."
2	"But, it's Money can be drawn is not going to."
2	"From school to read books to study part-time study because of non-life So, Reduce tuition fees for part-time and life experience, rather than the concept of making money can be done is will have to make a foothold."
2	"Part-time work is not bad to do that completely."
2	"Many students work part-time to earn pocket money, pay for tuition, or gain practical experience."
2	"However, I have never had a part-time job because I concentrate intensely on my studies."
2	"During my vacation, I obtained my certification for the police exam."
2	"Therefore, most people believe I was pampered as a child."
2	"One the one hand, I feel sad that I did not gain experience from part-time employment."
2	"I think part-time jobs can offer students practical experience."
2	"If students have part-time jobs, they can make many social connections."
2	"They can learn about teamwork and improve their understanding of the rules of courtesy that apply to adults."
2	"Practical experience can oil the wheels of student's social lives."
2	"Some people believe part-time jobs can interfere with studying."
2	"However, I believe that the practical experience students' can gain from part-time jobs will be more important in the future than the information they study now."
2	"If I were offered a part-time job, I would accept it."
2	"I want to learn the value of money so I can get the best bang for my buck."
2	"In addition, I want to learn the best ways to treat other human beings."
2	"If I do that, I will take a step forward on my way into the workforce."
2	"If you work and study hard: (1) You will have enough money to pay for higher education and achieve your dream."
2	"(2) You will gain more experience when you work with other people."
2	"You cannot gain this type of experience by attending a college/university."
2	"(2) You will have more opportunities to obtain a good position in a company if you work part-time."
2	"(4) You will learn effective time management."
2	5
2	"You will gain a better understanding of what it means to be independent from your parents or from anyone else."
2	"Of course, you will learn about real life."
2	"You will learn what to expect after you graduate."
2	"Most students are unable to imagine what they will face in their real lives."
2	"If you do not work and study: (1) On occasion, students forget to study because their part-time jobs absorb them completely."
2	"You must remember that studying is your most important task."
2	"(2) Of course, you will have less free time than other students."
2	"This can be a good thing because you will be earning money."
2	"However, your fellow students will be stupidly spending their parents' money."
2	"(2) You will not be able to join many school societies."
2	"Do you really need to join all of them?"
2	"However, you will be able to focus on activities you really need."
2	"Of course, you will have more points to consider that might affect your life."
2	"However, these points must be considered so you can make the correct decision."
2	"I agree that college students should have part-time jobs."
2	"First, students may have personal reasons for working part-time."
2	"I realize that university students have lots of free time."
2	"However, they often do not manage their time well."
2	"They waste time on play."
2	"Second, university students spend a great deal of money."
2	"However, their allowances are fixed."
2	"Often, they spend more money than they receive in their allowances."
2	"University students are not children."
2	"Therefore, they must learn to manage their time and money and take responsibility for their actions."
2	"If they need to buy things, they should earn money."
2	"Third, part-time jobs provide students with opportunities to improve their social skills."
2	"After students graduate from high school, they enter university."
2	"Often, their first social experiences are very difficult."
